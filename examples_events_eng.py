e[2] : """This meetup is for those who realize that Analytics is no longer just a shortcut for Google Analytics. 
Along with their bitter rival Amplitude, Mixpanel is currently, without a doubt, the leading behavioral Analytics platform. Built specifically for Product Managers, it is a tool so powerful that it is often used only to a fraction of its capabilities. 
But for those attending that is about to change! 

If you understand the importance of strong Analytics skills to a PM's tool box, this meetup is a must. If you don't, this meetup should convince you of that üòä 
*Most of the features we'll discuss are included in Mixpanel's free version.
